# ITManagementSystem (Actively being developed)
Project Overview:  
I've been actively developing an IT management application, a solution that streamlines various IT operations and tasks efficiently. This application is built using Java Spring, serverless cloud capabilities with Postman, and a robust database foundation involving MySQL, JDBC, Spring JPA, Hibernate ORM, and REST API integration. (I designed and created the database myself you can view the sql script in the resource folder)

Key Features:

Task Management: One of the core functionalities of the application is its task management system. Users, already registered within the system, can seamlessly add new tasks, specifying details such as task title, description, due date, priority, and status.

Task Modification: Beyond task creation, users can also modify existing tasks. The application allows for updates to task details, excluding critical fields like due date, title, or description, ensuring data integrity.

Task Deletion: Additionally, the system supports task deletion, offering users the flexibility to remove tasks that are no longer relevant or required.

Tech Stack Highlights:

Java Spring Framework: The backbone of the application, Java Spring, provides a robust and scalable platform for building web-based applications. It leverages the power of Java and offers comprehensive support for RESTful APIs.

Serverless Cloud Platform (Postman): By incorporating serverless architecture through Postman, the application achieves high scalability, cost efficiency, and seamless integration with other cloud services, ensuring optimal performance.

Database Expertise: The project excels in database development, utilizing MySQL for structured data storage. JDBC, Spring JPA, and Hibernate ORM play a vital role in managing database operations efficiently, while REST API endpoints facilitate secure data access.
